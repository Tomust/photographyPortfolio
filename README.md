# photographyPortfolio
My personal photography portfolio proyect made with Bootstrap, CSS and JS. <br/>
It consists of a home page with three separate galleries, a simple about me, and a contact form (all open to changes).
I still need to add some functionalities, like blurred background images that gets unblurred when the mouse hovers on the gallery <a>, and more!
